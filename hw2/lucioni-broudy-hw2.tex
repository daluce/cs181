\subproblem Bright-or-dark: at least 75\% of the pixels are on, or at least 75\% of the pixels are off. \\

A perceptron that recognizes bright-or-dark takes a vector of 9 inputs {\textbf{\emph{x}}} in which an on pixel is represented with a 1 and an off pixel is represented with a 0. The perceptron is defined by the set of weights {\textbf{\emph{w}}} in which all 9 weights are $\frac{1}{9}$, and has threshold activation function
\begin{equation*}
  g(s)=\begin{cases}
    +1, & \text{if $s \leq .25$ or $s \geq .75$}.\\
    -1, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subproblem Top-bright: a larger fraction of pixels is on in the top row than in the bottom two rows. \\

A perceptron that recognizes bright-or-dark takes a vector of 9 inputs {\textbf{\emph{x}}} in which an on pixel is represented with a 1 and an off pixel is represented with a 0. The first top row will be the first three of the nine and the bottom two rows will be the last six. The perceptron is defined by the set of weights {\textbf{\emph{w}}} in which the first three weights are  $\frac{1}{3}$, the last six weights are $\frac{-1}{6}$, and the threshold activation function is 
\begin{equation*}
  g(s)=\begin{cases}
    +1, & \text{if $s  >  0$}.\\
    -1, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

This equation works by calculating the top fraction (by adding $\frac{1}{3}$ for every 1) and then subtracting the bottom fraction (by subtracting  $\frac{1}{6}$ for every 1). 

\subproblem Connected: the set of pixels that are on is connected. \\
