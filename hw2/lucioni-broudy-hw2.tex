\subproblem Bright-or-dark: at least 75\% of the pixels are on, or at least 75\% of the pixels are off. \\

A perceptron that recognizes bright-or-dark takes a vector of 9 inputs {\textbf{\emph{x}}} in which an on pixel is represented with a 1 and an off pixel is represented with a 0. The perceptron is defined by the set of weights {\textbf{\emph{w}}} in which all 9 weights are $\frac{1}{9}$, and has threshold activation function
\begin{equation*}
  g(s)=\begin{cases}
    +1, & \text{if $s \leq .25$ or $s \geq .75$}.\\
    -1, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subproblem Top-bright: a larger fraction of pixels is on in the top row than in the bottom two rows. \\



\subproblem Connected: the set of pixels that are on is connected. \\
