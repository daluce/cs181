The diagram below illustrates the directed graph structure of the network.

The following describes a parameterization of the noise in the causal effects of the above dependencies.

$P(RD,SMOS,VRAS,MAI,NAI,VP) = 
P(MAI)P(NAI)P(RD)P(VRAS | MAI, NAI)P(SMOS | RD)P(VP | VRAS, SMOS)$\\

Nodes $MAI$, $NAI$, and $RD$ are binary attributes which are not conditional on any other attributes. They are each associated with a probability vector.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l |c r }
   $MAI = 0$ & $MAI = 1$ \\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l |c r }
   VRAS = 0 & NAI = 0 & NAI = 1 \\

\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l |c r }

   \hline
  MAI = 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  MAI = 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


P(SMOS | RD)\\
%SMOS $\in$ \{ 0,1\}\\
%RD $\in$ \{ 0,1\}\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l |c r }
   & RD = 0 & RD = 1 \\
   \hline
  SMOS = 0 & .8 & .2 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}


P(VP | VRAS, SMOS)\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l |c r }
   VP = 0 & SMOS = 0 & SMOS = 1 \\
   \hline
  VRAS = 0 & .7 & .1 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subproblem %b
 We made the assumption that VRAS and SMOS are independent. We could have plausibly not made this assumption and added an edge from SMOS to VRAS because if you have silly messages on the screen you probably have V-Rases all over the place.  
 
 Another adjustment we could make is to collapse the MAI node and the NAI node because it doesn't really matter if you have more than one virus software, its more important if it you just have Virus software present.

We are operating under the assumption that if one virus software reports the other is very likely to have reported as well.

\problem{24} %2
\subproblem 
- For graph (a) There are no variables that are Independent of A given the knowledge of B. There is a head-tail or a tail-tail connection to all other nodes (or a path that is a combination of these) and none of them are known so none of the paths are blocking. Therefore none of the nodes are independent of A given knowledge of B.\\
%see Reading http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/Bishop-PRML-sample.pdf 
%page 378.

- For graph (b) only F and C are independent of A given J. In this case we would think the path through G would be blocked because G is is a head to head node. With the knowledge of J, G does not block the path between A and D because J is a decedent node of G, this creates an induced dependence between A and D. This is not the case between D and E, H does not create induced dependence because it is unknown, that being said the existence of B, an unknown tail tail connection, means there is a dependence between D and E. Now finally between E and F we get independence because I is a head-head node and none of its descendants are known. This leaves us with the conclusion that F and C are the only two nodes that are independent of A when J is known. Knowledge of J creates a lot more dependence in this directed graph.

To generate data directly from the above distribution, we use the inversion method discussed in class. That is, we assume we have the CDF and inverse CDF of the distribution $f(x)$, then draw a point $u$ uniformly from the vertical axis. We input this point to the inverse of the CDF to get a corresponding value $u'$ on the horizontal axis. We use $u'$ as our sample.
